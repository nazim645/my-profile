        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>
        	Messi started football in his hometown of Rosario, Argentina with clubs Grandoli and Newell's Old Boys. Suffering from a growth problem, he joined FC Barcelona at the age of thirteen, which financed his hormonal treatment. An emblematic player of this club, of which he is notably the most capped player, he remained there for sixteen professional years before joining Paris Saint-Germain in 2021 to continue his career.

        	<h4>Personal Life</h4>
        	<p>
        		Married for three years but together for over a decade, Argentinian soccer player Lionel "Leo" Messi and his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, have three adorable sons together, Thiago, Mateo, and Ciro.
        		Leo opened up in an interview about how his kids have shaped his outlook on life: "You grow and you learn. You gather experience in all aspects of life, on and off the field. But, as a human being, having three children changed my perspective on life, my way of thinking and it also helped me grow."
                The Messi-Roccuzzo boys are always popping up on both their dad and mom's social media; from family-vacation posts to outdoor hangouts, we can always count on seeing one of their cute, smiling faces. And soccer fans are eagerly waiting to see which of the three Messi-Roccuzzo brothers will follow in their father's magical soccer footsteps.
